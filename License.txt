Use the contents of whatever is under this license for whatever you want.
Exceptions are:
- Do not patent or license it in order to prevent others* from using this content.
- Do not patent or license it in order to sue others using this content.
- Do not patent, license or do anything else** in order to be able to use this content
to create trouble*** to others in a way that another license would have prevented.

Although you are not restricted from, you are still encouraged to refrain from:
- Take this content and take claim to have created it.
- Being a jerk.



And it would be appreciated if you gave credits when appropriate.



However, if otherwise specified, the specified rules takes precedence over whatever is written here.
This paragraph holds as long as the specified rules was added by (or with the consent of)
the owner of the content it is regarding.
And unless its specified in a manner that should be obvious for people using the content,
they cant be held responsible to know about what you specified.
If notified about it, they do need to oblige by whatever is specified within a reasonable amount of time,
or stop using that content.


The creator or distributor of this content has no responsibility whatsoever for the content,
or distribution of the content, unless otherwise specified.
An example would be a distributor signing a contract for distributing the content,
where what is specified in the contract would take precedence instead.




* Others means anyone, be it person, animal or creator of content, apart from you.

** "Anything else" is extremely vague, but it is so because I cant possible define everything you
could do in order to create trouble. For example, if the content under this license is
a blueprint of a weapon (or the weapon itself), you are not allowed to use it to kill people.
The clause of "otherwise specified" could obviously be used to override this example.

*** Trouble is a vague word, but be reasonable about it. A large company arguing they are losing fantasy
sums of money because of you using this content are not really troubled. An individual being blackmailed
by the threat of court is, and so is even a large company forced to break their product by being forced
to remove the content
