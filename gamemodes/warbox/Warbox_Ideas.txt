
RTS-View:
Players control as noclipping players with binds to do rts stuff like ordering around.
This is because you build your tanks easy that way.
But there should be a standard top-down rts-view players can use if they prefer that,
although they will not be able to build when using it.
The technical stuff:
Players are made invisible (and frozen?), assigned to use a new camera.
Alternativelly I use the player-entity and set their camera to a fixed angle.
The camera is moved by wasd keys, but remove any height-direction from it.
The GUI will look rts-ish, where you control with an unlocked mouse-pointer.
Lock the q-menu so it cant even be brought up while in this mode, and use hud buttons instead?
q-menu could bring up a larger version of the map instead?



shorter TODO:

- A system to place and save entities on the map, which can be loaded on map-load.
 think wmrts variant system, you cant have a gamemode that requires admins 24/7 or recreating the map everytime.
 Could be solved by mapper placing stuff, but letting it be done ingame is more versatile.

- A message system to print messages for players, teams and all ("you dont have enough res" and such)

- A chatcmd system, for joining teams and possibly something more

- Uuhhhhh... Its starting to become more urgent that I actually create some sort of hud I think...

- A research tree to slow down access to certain units (and possible target to remove acces for enemy)

- A res harvesting symbiosis between 2 or more entities

- A Base used to determine a loss, and territory system limiting area of influence

- A cannon/splash unit that shoot explosive shells

- A sniper class of unit

- A "meelee" kind of unit

- An anti-stationary kind of unit (maybe similar to wmrts laser?)

- A "medic" kind of unit. stationary? aoe? continuous like tf2?

- Anti air. flak like wmrts? splash damage really is preferably for something
 like AA since the idea is to cripple flight systems, which in gmod often get hidden.
 Could possibly also be something like instant laser that can ignore blocking props,
 but this would not work well against flight spam...
